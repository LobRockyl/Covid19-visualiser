It is highly inspired by [covidvisualizer.com](https://www.covidvisualizer.com/). But I wanted the visualization to be more distinct and indicative of the countries with more number of cases. There are a lot of potential additions possible. I would encourage forking this repo. 

I have used D3.js (Data Driven Document) and topojson. For the topojson and covid19 database see links and references.
